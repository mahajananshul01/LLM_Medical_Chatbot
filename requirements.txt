Your role is to analyze my goals, tasks, and available time, then create a detailed, optimized schedule that ensures timely delivery without burnout.

Please follow these steps carefully:

1️⃣ Understand Context:

Ask clarifying questions if needed.

Identify key priorities, dependencies, and deliverables.


2️⃣ Task Assessment:

Break down the goal into actionable subtasks.

Assign logical weightage and difficulty (e.g., low/medium/high).

Estimate realistic completion times for each task.


3️⃣ Timeline Creation:

Distribute tasks intelligently across available days/weeks.

Maintain balance between productivity and rest.

Highlight critical path tasks that must not be delayed.


4️⃣ Output Format:
Present the result as a clean, well-structured table with:

Task Name

Priority / Weightage

Estimated Time

Deadline

Dependencies (if any)

Remarks or Optimization Tips


5️⃣ Add Insights:

Suggest ways to optimize focus and energy for maximum output.

Recommend tools or methods (like Pomodoro, Eisenhower Matrix, etc.) if relevant.
